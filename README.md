## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Flex
- Javascript

### What I learned

1. How to style inputs in valid and invalid states
2. How to use regular expressions for email and password patterns
3. How to use javascript to check for password match
4. How to send to a thank you page on form submission
5. How to style checkboxes...tricky!


### Continued development

This was good practice getting back to HTML and CSS. After finishing foundations, a lot of my focus had been on Javascript. I then tried to learn Tailwind while I worked through this section, but found myself missing regular CSS so I stuck with that here. My goal from here on out is =to maintain a focus on quality CSS work because it can really be the most frustrating aspect of coding, but also the most enjoyable.
